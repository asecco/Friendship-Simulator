# Friendship-Simulator
Developed for a class project using GameMaker Studio with the GML language with the purpose of bringing people together to have a friendly competition in fun mini-games. Inspired by old Mario Party games. This is an old project from 2018 which I no longer have the the original files for, although the the game is still playable with the exe provided.

The game features 3 different mini-games (Pong, Air Hockey, Duel):
